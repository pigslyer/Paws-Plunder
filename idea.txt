chaos:

cats invade mouse ships
ship gets more fucked up over time
modifiers?

open top of the ship -> go inside -> more cramped corridors + some open rooms

for a start:
projectiles
single ship, sinking, a couple of enemies
billboarded sprites for all interactables

perpetual dual wielding: one hand claw, other hand gun
whenever you have a gun, you get 1 shot
need log (you picked up mouse's gun)
health as 3 hearts

start with a strong one

enemies:
big tringular rat with a blunderbuss
grunt rats with normal pistol
sniper rats in the rafters
adhd trader mice (how do they impact scoring)

ship sections can be damaged over time? have callouts for which part is about to be hit?
shoot in and out (control where you die?)
when you die, new cat gets sent in (new stats, 9 per playthrough?)

kris handles visuals
music is good
hermi handles ship
matej handles enemy sprites (including animations)

minimum required score to escape via cannon

cat themed treasures for score (lasagna worth less once covered in water)
as you're more submerged, you get stressed cat sounds as water level rises, then start taking damage (no altered controls)

you play as "cat", with pool of cat names
main menu you're in the cannon that launches you, new game launches you

use a discord channel for todo, threads for followups

mišel v redu (petek je ni)

ermi 28. ga ni
